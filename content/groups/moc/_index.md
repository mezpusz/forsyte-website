The Models of Computation (MoC) group is committed to studying techniques, tools, and frameworks for modelling and reasoning about the correctness and reliability of software and systems. We strive to make a meaningful impact on the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex and critical systems by enabling better understanding and confidence in their behavior. For this, the MoC group applies techniques from and contributes to the fields of verification, program analysis, logic and automata theory.
