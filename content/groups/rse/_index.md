Over the last decades, the complexity of computer systems has increased dramatically and so has their ubiquity and importance to the general public. Designers today need computer-assisted methods and tools to support them in the design process. The use of methods like model checking has traditionally been aâ€‘posteriori. Within ARiSE, we aim at to extend such methods to a mathematically rigorous framework that helps the programmer during, instead of after the design process.
