The RiSE group focuses on mathematically rigorous methods and
techniques for developing software and computer systems. Our research
interests cover the entire development process, ranging from the
specification of system properties, synthesis of software and hardware
components, model-based testing and test case generation, automated
formal verification techniques such as model checking, as well as the
diagnosis, localization, and repair of faults.
