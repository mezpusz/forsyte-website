<p><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~laurako/" target="_blank">Laura Kov√°cs</a> and Georg Weissenbacher are the organizers of the second <a href="http://vsl2014.at/meetings/iPRA-index.html" target="_blank">workshop on Craig interpolation and its applications</a>.<span id="more-3328"/> After a very successful <a href="http://cav2013.forsyte.at/workshops/interpolation/" target="_blank">first edition of the workshop</a> in St. Petersburg in 2013 (co-located with the CAV conference, which was also organized by the Forsyte group), the second workshop has an even stronger focus on bringing researchers from different communities together: the workshop features three distinguished invited speakers from the fields of complexity theory, description logics, and verification, and 14 talks on theoretical aspects of interpolation as well as applications in decision procedures, game theory, synthesis, verification, and description logics.</p>
