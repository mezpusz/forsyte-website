<p>In memory of <a href="http://forsyte.at/2016/03/helmut-veith-1971-2016/">Helmut Veith</a>, the founder of the FORSYTE research group, the current issue of the Journal on Formal Methods in System Design is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10703-017-0307-6">Special Issue in Memoriam Helmut Veith</a>.<span id="more-5887"/> Helmut unexpectedly passed away in March 2016; he was a brilliant researcher, inspiring collaborator, passionate mentor, generous friend, and valued member of the formal methods community. Helmut was not only known for his numerous and influential contributions in the field of automated verification (most prominently his work on Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement), but also for his untiring and passionate efforts for the logic community. He is sorely missed.</p>
