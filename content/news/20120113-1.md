<p>We are glad to announce that TU Vienna will award an honorary doctorate to Ed Clarke.</p>
<p><strong>Edmund M. Clarke</strong> is among the leading computer scientists of our times. As a professor at Harvard, and, since 1982, at Carnegie Mellon University, he and his group have not only laid the theoretical and logical foundations of model checking (ACM Turing Award, 2007), but also pioneered model checking as a powerful tool for industrial hardware and software engineering.</p>
<p>On January 26, 2012, as part of the <a title="Official Opening of VCLA" href="http://www.vcla.at/events/official-opening/">festive opening of the Vienna Center for Logic and Algorithms</a>, Prof. Clarke will be awarded an honorary doctorate from TU Vienna&nbsp;in recognition of his contributions to Computer Science.</p>
