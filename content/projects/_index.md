<p>The three pillars of FORSYTE are:
<ul>
<li><a href="/groups/rse/">Rigorous Systems Engineering</a></li>
<li><a href="/groups/apre/">Automated Program Reasoning</a></li>
<li><a href="/groups/moc/">Models Of Computation</a></li>
</ul>
</p> 

<p>The research unit is concerned with the development of both theoretical foundations and practical approaches for software and hardware verification and engineering.</p>

<p>Fundamental research topics include software model checking, test case generation, static analysis, protocol verification, and formal methods for distributed and concurrent systems. Industrial research is focusing on low level software, and embedded systems in the avionics and automotive sector.</p>
