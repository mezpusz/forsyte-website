The doctorate program (Graduiertenkolleg) PUMA brings together the four fundamental approaches of program and model analysis, namely, type systems, theorem proving, model-checking, and abstract interpretation. Its goal is to develop new analysis techniques through cross-fertilization. The new methods should prototypically be implemented and be evaluated on selected analysis problems of software-intensive systems.
