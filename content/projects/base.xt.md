Within the BASE.XT project a rigorous model-driven development (MDD) approach for software-intensive automotive systems has been developed in cooperation with BMW Group. The COLA-IDE, i.e., the authoring tool supporting this MDD approach, facilitates modelling on different levels of abstraction (requirements specification and analysis, behavioral modelling, and modelling of the execution platform) aiming at complexity reduction and separation of concerns. Several case studies demonstrated the feasibility of the presented approach.
