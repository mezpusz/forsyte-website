Critical distributed systems are designed to tolerate faults of individual components: they must work even if some of their components fail. In <a href="http://forsyte.at/research/apalache/">APALACHE</a>, we address two technical and methodological challenges:&nbsp;Domain-specific abstraction for fault-tolerant TLA+ designs, and parameterized model checking techniques for an unbounded number of components.
